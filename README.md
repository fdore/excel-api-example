# excel-api-example
This repo demonstrates the usage of JavaScript Excel API provided by Openfin.

Note: This demo is intentionally coded in plain JavaScript so that its easy to follow,
without any need to understand other technologies/ frameworks.

# How to Run the Demo

1) Download and run the installer.
[openfin installer download](https://dl.openfin.co/services/download?fileName=excel-api-example-installer&config=http://openfin.github.io/excel-api-example/app.json)

2) After the installer runs, the OpenFin application should launch and automatically start Excel. At this point you should be able to interact with eith either application (create workbooks, worksheets, update cells, etc.) and see it mirrored on the other side.

4) If you initially don't see workbooks on Openfin side, refresh the HTML page.

##How to Run Locally, for Development
For development purposes you may wish to clone this repository and run on a local computer. The Excel Add-In is only compatible with Excel for Windows.

Pre-requisite: Node and NPM must be installed ( [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) ).

Clone the repositry and, in the Command Prompt, navigate into the 'excel-api-example' directory created.

In the Command Prompt run:

```
> npm install
```
Once the Node packages have installed, in the same 'excel-api-example' directory, run:

```
> npm start
```
This will start a simple HTTP server on port 8080 and launch the OpenFin App automatically.
   
## Custom Functions:
The Excel plugin also allows you to call custom JS functions from excel.
You can use them to do some complicated calculations using your connected app and feed the
result back to Excel, or you can simply use them to register cells that you would like to be
updated by your connected app.

You can call a custom function by entering following in the formula bar:

```
=CustomFunction("nameOfTheJSFunction", "comma,separated,arguments")
```
the above function call will call a function in JavaScript app as following:  

```
nameOfTheJSFunction("comma", "separated", "arguments");
```
There are two sample functions included in the demo app for demonstration.

To try the custom functions:

1) Enter some numbers in a column formation.

2) In any empty cell make the following call 
```
=CustomFunction("averageColumn", "startingCellAddress,columnHeight,resultDestination")
e.g  =CustomFunction("averageColumn", "A1,7,A8")
```

the above example will call a function defined in JavaScript app (averageColumn("A1", 7, "A8"))
and the defined JavaScript function will take the average of column values from A1 to A7 and update the result in cell A8.

3) The second function is =CustomFunction("averageRow", "A1,7,H1").

The above example will take the average of row values from A1 to G1 and update the cell at H1 with the result.

4) You can also define your own custom functions on the fly and call them from excel.
To try your own custom function you can open the JS console from the demo app and define a test function by typing in the console.
e.g 

```var test = function(){console.log("excel just called me with these arguments", arguments)}```

5) Now go ahead and call your defined function from excel.

```
e.g =CustomFunction("test","a,b,c")
```
you will see following string printed out in the console. "excel just called me with these arguments ['a', 'b', 'c']"


# API Documentation

The Excel API is composition based object model. Where Excel is the top most level which has workbooks which have worksheets and worksheets have cells.
To use the API you will need to include ExcelAPI.js in your project and it will extend Openfin API with Excel API included.
Once included you will be able to use following API calls.


##fin.desktop.Excel:
**methods:**

``` javascript
/*
init();
this function is required to be executed before using the rest of the API.
*/
fin.desktop.init();

/*
getWorkbooks(callback);
Retrieves currently opened workbooks from excel and passes an array of workbook objects as an argument to the callback.
*/
fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbooks(function(workbooks){...});

/*
addWorkbook(callback);
creates a new workbook in Excel
*/
fin.desktop.Excel.addWorkbook(function(workbook){...});

/*
openWorkbook(path, callback);
opens workbook from the specified path and passes the workbook object to the callback
*/
fin.desktop.Excel.openWorkbook(function(workbook){...});

/*
getWorkbookByName(name);

Note: to use this function, you need to call getWorkbooks at least once.
*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");

/*
getConnectionStatus(callback);
Passes true to the callback if its connected to Excel
*/
fin.desktop.Excel.getConnectionStatus(function(isConnected){...});

*/
fin.desktop.Excel.calculateAll();

/*
addEventListener(type, listener);

*/
fin.desktop.Excel.addEventListener("workbookAdded", function(event){...})

/*
removeEventListener(type, listener);

*/
removeEventListener("workbookAdded", handler);
```
**events:**
```javascript

{type: "connected"};
// is fired when excel connects to Openfin.
//Example:
fin.desktop.Excel.addEventListener("connected", function(){ console.log("Connected to Excel"); })

{type: "workbookAdded", workbook: ExcelWorkbook};
//is fired when a new workbook is added in excel (this includes adding workbooks using API).
//Example:
fin.desktop.Excel.addEventListener("workbookAdded",
function(event){
    console.log("New workbook added; Name:", event.workbook.name);
});

{type: "workbookClosed", workbook: ExcelWorkbook};
//is fired when a workbook is closed.
//Example:
fin.desktop.Excel.addEventListener("workbookClosed",
function(event){
    console.log("Workbook closed; Name:", event.workbook.name);
});

{type: "afterCalculation"};
//is fired when calculation is complete on any sheet.
//Example:
fin.desktop.Excel.addEventListener("afterCalculation",
function(event){
    console.log("calculation is complete.";
});

```

##fin.desktop.ExcelWorkbook:
Represents an Excel workbook.
Note: New workbooks are not supposed to be created using new or Object.create().
Workbook objects can only be retrieved using API calls like fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbooks() fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName() and fin.desktop.Excel.addWorkbook() etc.

**properties:**
```javascript
name: String // name of the workbook that the object represents.
```

**methods:**
```javascript
/*
getWorksheets(callback);

*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.getWorksheets(function(worksheets){...});

/*
getWorksheetByName(name);
returns the worksheet object with the specified name.
Note: you have to at least use getWorksheets() once before using this function.
*/

var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
var sheet = workbook.getWorksheetByName("sheet1");


/*
addWorksheet(callback);
creates a new worksheet and passes the worksheet object to the callback
*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.addWorksheet(function(sheet){...});

/*
activate();
activates or brings focus to the workbook
*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.activate();

/*
save();
Saves the changes to the workbook.
*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.save();

/*
close();
Closes the workbook.
*/
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.close();



```
**events:**
```javascript
{type: "sheetAdded", target: ExcelWorkbook, worksheet: ExcelWorksheet};
//fired when a new sheet is added to the workbook
//Example:
var workbook = fin.desktop.Excel.getWorkbookByName("workbook1");
workbook.addEventListener("sheetAdded",
function(event){
    console.log("New sheet", event.worksheet.name, "was added to the workbook", event.worksheet.workbook.name)
});
